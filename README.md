### Reflections and Comments
Today was a great day, the JS came easy today I think I am beginning to write it better and faster I can see it cleareer even if i dont fully understand its meaning i can see what its doing. the struggle today was the table this took almost an hour to get correct mostly because the footer totals was fighting me, but i was able to eventually able to get it at the bottom. i enjoyed working with the classes today and seeing them gives me a little hope im not completely out of my depth.
