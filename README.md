Today was challenging but rewarding it was a struggle but was rewarding in the end to finsally overcome my former obstacle of the total cell in the table and over come the challenge of the forms. Definitely could of worked faster today but I think taking my time helped me undertand better and get my styling right in css without getting as frustrated making it a more productive day.
